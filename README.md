# Beat Back the Horde!
BBTH is a rhythm-time strategy game available now on the Android marketplace: https://market.android.com/details?id=bbth.game. It was developed by Tala Huhe, Evan Wallace, Justin Ardini, Nathan Partlan, Zach Davis, and Kayle Gishen for a class project at Brown University.

## What is BBTH?

Two players battle it out to music, tapping the screen with the beat to create 
units that attack their opponent's base. They frantically wall off their base 
during hold beats and build up combos to make uber units. Only one will manage 
to Beat Back The Horde!
